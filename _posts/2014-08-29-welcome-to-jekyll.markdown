Recently I ended my hosting contract where I hosted by wordpress blog; realized that I was wasting a lot of time maintaining wordpress than actually writing something meaningful. Had read a lot about Jekyll & Github pages and always wanted to try it out, so this was my opportunity.

There are tons of posts that describe how to get started with Jekyll and Github pages, here are a few links that I found most helpful:
http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/


To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].

{% highlight js %}

<footer class="site-footer">
 <a class="subscribe" href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"> <span class="tooltip"> <i class="fa fa-rss"></i> Subscribe!</span></a>
  <div class="inner">a
   <section class="copyright">All content copyright <a href="mailto:{{ site.email}}">{{ site.name }}</a> &copy; {{ site.time | date: '%Y' }} &bull; All rights reserved.</section>
   <section class="poweredby">Made with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com"> Jekyll</a></section>
  </div>
</footer>
{% endhighlight %}
