I don't think Arduino needs an introduction, its an amazing open source hardware technology. Have always wanted to work on it, so I finally bought an arduino board for $25 from Amazon and stater kit from eBay. Revived my rusty electronics concepts, its been a ling time since I worked on breadboards, resistors, 8085 & 8086 programming and it seems like its all coming back together.

So here my first very simple program to fade in and fade out LED using analog output from Arduino. I used the setup from the FADE example on the arduino site.
