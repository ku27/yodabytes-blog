<p>Recently ended my hosting contract when I realized I was wasting a lot of time maintaining Wordpress than actually writing something meaningful. Had read a lot about Jekyll &amp; Github pages so I always wanted to try it out and I have to say I am really glad I did. It much simpler to post with Jekyll, you have the comfort of using your favorite editor and best part is.. wait of it.. Github pages is free!</p>

<p>There are tons of posts that describe how to get started with Jekyll and Github pages, here are a few links that I found most helpful:</p>
