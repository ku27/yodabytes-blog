Recently ended my hosting contract when I realized I was wasting a lot of time maintaining Wordpress than actually writing something meaningful. Had read a lot about Jekyll & Github pages so I always wanted to try it out and I have to say I am really glad I did. It much simpler to post with Jekyll, you have the comfort of using your favorite editor and best part is.. wait of it.. Github pages is free!

There are tons of posts that describe how to get started with Jekyll and Github pages, here are a few links that I found most helpful:
